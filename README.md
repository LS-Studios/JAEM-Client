## 📝 Description
**JAEM** is an encrypted messaging app designed for secure, private, and distraction-free communication.  

With JAEM, you'll never receive annoying requests from bots or scammers pretending to be someone else. Instead, you can communicate **confidentially and securely** through strong end-to-end encryption.  

Messages are stored only until your recipient receives them, ensuring that **nobody except you and your conversation partner** can ever read your conversations.
