# JAEM – Just Another Encrypted Messenger

JAEM is an encrypted messaging app designed for secure, private, and distraction-free communication.

With JAEM, you'll never receive annoying requests from bots or scammers pretending to be someone else—such as your mom—but instead communicate privately, securely, and confidentially. JAEM ensures your privacy through strong end-to-end encryption, and messages are stored only until your communication partner receives them. That means nobody, except you and the person you're messaging, can ever see your conversation.
